Catalytic Deterministic Programming Structure For Large Complex Projects


Large and complex projects are the fun stuff for software developers, but not for longer attachment. They quickly become a bane if not managed well. Such projects take months and years to build but if mismanaged, they quickly become an irreversible nightmare. That’s why we built “[Determiner](https://github.com/cyberiums/determiner)“.




This module is supposed to work as a catalytic facilitator to unwrap micro-tasks for a large and complex projects. It is an open source module with MIT license.


Determiner works based on smart product story of [FastBuilder.AI](https://fastbuilder.ai).

It fetches the micro-tasks from the plan section.

You add a master prompt set for various parts of the project.

And then the magic! Generate bulk code.

It is language agnostic. And community driven.

*   ### Ideas are welcome
    
    Comments, ideas and suggestions are welcome.
    
*   ### No offense
    
    Respect ideas and be open to criticism. No personal attacks. We just need one craziness, and that is this mission.
    
*   ### Github for code. Fastbuilder for story.
    
    All the code, comments and discussion shall be on Github. FastBuilder shall hold the smart story of Determiner, as well. Of course, Determiner shall unwrap Determiner at post first beta.

[And The Story Hub](https://www.cyberium.info/products/story-hub/)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Story hub is a term that describes a collection of distinct product stories that are interrelated and linked together, forming a cohesive narrative. This concept is especially important in marketing, where the ability to convey a clear and compelling brand message can make all the difference in attracting and retaining customers. By gathering these stories into a single hub, companies can provide a more immersive and engaging experience for their audience, helping them to understand the unique features and benefits of their products. Whether it’s highlighting the craftsmanship behind a particular product, showcasing its innovative design elements or demonstrating its versatility and adaptability, a story hub can help to bring your products to life through compelling stories that resonate with your target audience. So, if you’re looking to create a more impactful and effective marketing strategy, consider leveraging the power of story hub to connect your products and engage your customers on a deeper level.
